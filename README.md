# IoT-Based-Automatic-Accident-Detection-and-Rescue-System

Project Overview

The IoT-Based Automatic Accident Detection and Rescue System is designed to enhance road safety by automatically detecting accidents and alerting emergency services in real-time. This project utilizes various sensors and communication modules to monitor vehicle conditions and driver behavior, ensuring prompt assistance in case of emergencies.

Features
- Accelerometer Sensor: Detects sudden changes in acceleration indicative of accidents.
- GPS Module: Provides accurate location data of the accident site.
- GSM Module: Sends automated distress messages to emergency services.
- Eye Blink Sensor: Monitors driver fatigue to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness.
- Temperature Sensor (LM35): Measures ambient temperature for environmental data.
- Alcohol Sensor (MQ-3): Detects alcohol levels to prevent drunk driving.
- LCD Display: Provides real-time information and status updates.
- DC Motor: Simulates engine movement to indicate an accident.
